# learn-graphql

A standard babel setup for GraphQL.

## About

- Learn graphql via Express.
- Each branches merged are different versions of the project.
- Ideally, we should be using `graphql-tools` to export into databases like MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc. But we won't be using those here. Instead we will be storing into a variable.
